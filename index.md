### How I make computers my slaves.

I'm not boasting or claiming I can hack anyone and make anyone _else's_ computers my slaves. The computers I am responsible for and own.

I'm also not claiming I'm perfect; there is a lot I can still learn, and I am hoping people can help me (once I figure out how to communicate with anyone, using this...)

Hoping to make this a blog detailing the various hacks and tools I use to make computers work _for me_. To make my life easier, to entertain myself, and all sorts of other things.

I'm hoping I can share some tips, some of the tricks I've learned in my years of experience working with Linux, git, configuration management, shell scripting, perl scripting, etc.

I'm expecting I will learn some new tricks, and have to break some existing habits. If this manages to be mildly popular, that's a certainty. :D
